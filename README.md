# Maven Tiles

## WHAT IS MAVEN TILES

Maven Tiles is a Maven Plugin (tiles-maven-plugin) that tries to bring a new level of modularity to Maven, allowing to include multiple pom snippets into your project and overcoming the bottleneck of having the project's parent as single point of inheritance.

## WHAT IS A MAVEN TILE

Tiles are [plain Maven pom artifacts](https://github.com/maoo/maven-tiles-examples/tree/master/tiles) which contain parts of a Maven POM; every tile can contain
- build data, for example the license tags that a company wants to report on all their artifacts
- build aspects, for example the runnability of a project could be defined into a jetty-maven-plugin-tile

## FEATURE DRIVEN TILES

The most powerful advantage comes with feature-driven tiles; if we need to perform a remote deployment using [cargo](http://cargo.codehaus.org/Maven2+plugin), the first action is to google for "cargo maven", find some pom.xml snippets, copy/paste into your build, change some properties and give it a try. Maven Tiles basically allows you to reuse this copy/paste and reference it across an infinite number of Maven builds; no copy/paste guaranteed!

## SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

Maven Tiles delivers an additional Separation of Concern into the Software Automation market: software products (e.g. RedHat JBoss) could deliver - along with the artifacts - the build behaviors (e.g. cargo-maven-plugin + configuration) that proved to be stable and consistent; developers will be able to browse Maven repositories and find the tiles they're interested to embed in their builds.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

Sometime tiles can be counter-productive to use; for example the maven-resources-tile contains the build resource configuration, which are commonly different for each project; moving it to another file just makes it more difficult for a dev to read it.

A great tool for supporting Maven POM development is the [maven-help-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin); before running a tile-aggregated build, just launch [mvn help:effective-pom](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin/effective-pom-mojo.html) and analyse the final POM file that gets executed

## WHAT IS WORKING

- Aggregate [multiple tiles in one single pom](https://github.com/maoo/maven-tiles-examples/blob/master/wicket-quickstart/pom.xml)
- Tiles get [inherited from the POM parent](https://github.com/maoo/maven-tiles-examples/blob/master/wicket-quickstart/runner/pom.xml)

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE TESTED

- Maven properties defined within a tile should be visible from others
- What happens when 2 tiles define the same configuration?
- What happens when 2 tiles define 2 different executions of the same plugin?


## CURRENT ISSUES

- Plugin versions cannot be parametrized(!) - see maven-eclipse-tile
- Test Coverage
